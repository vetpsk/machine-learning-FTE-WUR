## Codes from course ML (FTE-35306)
[Go to links to practicals from Book: Introduction to statistical learning in R](#practical-links)
<br/><br/>After successful completion of this course, students are able to
     
     •. clearly explain machine learning problems, algorithms, and their formulas,
     
     •. understand well how machine learning can be used in{biosystems engineering (MAB),{bioinformatics (MBF),{geo-information sciences and remote sensing (MGI {another  eld of study,
     
     •. qualitatively  and  quantitatively  compare  the  characteristics,  (dis)advantages,  formulas,  andperformance of a number of key algorithms, and
     
     •. design and implement e ective solutions based on chosen algorithms, to solve practical prob-lems
